<h1>Appsperse Inc. Privacy Policy</h1>

	
	<p>We at Appsperse, Inc. (&#8220;Appsperse,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221;) know that our
 users ( &#8220;you,&#8221;  &#8220;your&#8221;) care about how your personal information is 
used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously.  Please read the 
following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. <strong>By visiting or
 using the Website or Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you 
accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and 
you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information
 in the following ways.</strong>  Any capitalized terms used herein 
without definition shall have the meaning given to them in the Appsperse
 Terms of Use which can be found at <a href="http://www.appsperse.com/terms">www.appsperse.com/terms.</a> 
	</p>
	
<h2 class="sectionTitle">I. WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable 
information (&#8220;Personal Information&#8221;) that we gather when you are 
accessing or using our Website and/or Services.  This policy does not 
apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to
 individuals that we do not employ or manage.</p>

<p>
We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone 
under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for the 
Services (as that term is defined in our Terms of Use at 
www.appsperse.com/terms). If you are under 13, please do not attempt to 
register for the Services or send any information about yourself to us, 
including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one
 under age 13 may provide any personal information to us or on the 
Services. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal 
information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental 
consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you 
believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 
13, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@appsperse.com?Subject=Hello%20contact">contact@appsperse.com.</a>
</p>

<h2 class="sectionTitle">II. WHAT INFORMATION DOES APPSPERSE COLLECT?</h2>

<p>We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as 
explained more fully below.  We may use this Personal Information to 
personalize and improve our services, to allow our users to set up a 
user account and profile, to contact users, to fulfill your requests for
 certain products and services, to analyze how users utilize the Website
 and Services, to improve the app recommendation engine and the 
underlying Appsperse machine learning algorithms/artificial 
intelligence, and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. We may 
share certain types of Personal Information with third parties 
(described in this Section and in Section III below).  We collect the 
following types of information:
</p>
<h3 class="subTitle">A. Information You Provide to Us:</h3>
<p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us.  
For example, we collect Personal Information such as your name, email 
address, cell phone number, and mailing address. You can choose not to 
provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to 
register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.  We may 
anonymize your Personal Information so that you cannot be individually 
identified, and provide that information to our partners.</p>  

<h3 class="subTitle">B. Information Collected Automatically:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
	In addition to the Personal Information you provide to Appsperse, 
Appsperse collects information on your end-users (&#8220;End-User 
Information&#8221;). The End-User Information collected by Appsperse includes 
without limitation location information and a unique identifier for each
 device that contacts our network. Appsperse will use such End-User 
Information internally to enhance the app recommendation engine and the 
underlying artificial intelligence/machine learning algorithms that 
power the app recommendation engine in general. Appsperse reserves the 
right to use the End User Information internally for the further 
improvement of its services and features throughout the life of its 
services.
	</li>  
	
	<li>  
	Whenever you interact with our Website, we automatically receive and 
record information on our server logs from your browser including your 
IP address, &#8220;cookie&#8221; information, and the page you requested. &#8220;Cookies&#8221; 
are identifiers we transfer to your computer or mobile device that allow
 us to recognize your browser or mobile device and tell us how and when 
pages in our Website are visited and by how many people.  You may be 
able to change the preferences on your browser or mobile device to 
prevent or limit your computer or device's acceptance of cookies, but 
this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our Website's 
features.  Our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your 
computer or device, when you click on ads that appear on the Website. 
Also, if you click on a link to a third party website, such third party 
may also transmit cookies to you.  This Privacy Policy does not cover 
the use of cookies by any third parties.
	</li>

	<li>When we collect usage information (such as the numbers and 
frequency of visitors to the Website), we only use this data in 
aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. 
 For example, this aggregate data tells us how often users use parts of 
the Website, so that we can make the Website appealing to as many users 
as possible.  We may also provide this aggregate information to our 
partners; our partners may use such information to understand how often 
and in what ways people use our Website, so that they, too, can provide 
you with an optimal experience. We never disclose aggregate information 
to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="subTitle">C. E-mail and Other Communications:</h3>
<p>We may contact you, by email or other means; for example, we may send
 you promotional offers on behalf of other businesses, promotional 
offers on behalf of the Appsperse service, or communicate with you about
 your use of the Website.  If you do not want to receive email or other 
mail from us, please indicate your preference by emailing: 
contact@appsperse.com.  Please note that if you do not want to receive 
legal notices from us, those legal notices will still govern your use of
 the Website, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices 
for changes.</p>

<h2 class="sectionTitle">III. WILL APPSPERSE SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?</h2>

<p>We do not sell your Information in personally identifiable form to 
anyone.  We share your Information in personally identifiable form with 
third parties as described below.</p> 

<h3 class="subTitle">A.  Within the Appsperse Platform:</h3>  <p>The 
Appsperse platform is an app cross promotion network that utilizes an 
app recommendation engine to surface the promotions in places that have a
 higher chance of an install and new end user.  Appsperse will not share
 the results of your individual campaigns with other registered users, 
nor will Appsperse share the results of your campaigns in aggregate with
 other registered users.  Appsperse will use the results internally to 
improve the service. The foregoing also applies in the event that you 
decide to not use the broader network for promotion and instead directly
 cross promote with other specific apps.</p>
  
<h3 class="subTitle">B. Affiliated Businesses and Third Party Websites We Do Not Control:</h3><p>
 In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we're 
affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the 
Website (either alone or jointly with us).  You can recognize when an 
affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, 
and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated 
business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or 
service.</p>

<h3 class="subTitle">C. Agents:</h3><p>We employ other companies and 
people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information
 with them to provide products or services to you.    Unless we tell you
 differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal 
Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.</p>
 
<h3 class="subTitle">D. User Profiles and Submissions:</h3><p>Certain 
user profile information, including without limitation a user's name, 
location, and any video or image content that such user has uploaded to 
the Website, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user 
interaction within the Website or address your request for Appsperse's 
services.  Your account privacy settings allow you to limit the other 
users who can see the Personal Information in your user profile and/or 
what information in your user profile is visible to others.  Any content
 you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal 
Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner 
other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, 
etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by 
others.  Your user name may also be displayed to other users if and when
 you send messages or comments or upload images or videos through the 
Website and other users can contact you through messages and comments. </p> 

<h3 class="subTitle">E. Business Transfers:</h3><p> We may choose to buy
 or sell assets.  In these types of transactions, customer information 
is typically one of the business assets that is transferred.  Also, if 
we (or substantially all of our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of
 business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control,
 Personal Information would be one of the assets transferred to or 
acquired by a third party. </p>

<h3 class="subTitle">F. Protection of Appsperse and Others:</h3><p> We 
reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any 
information that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law 
or court order; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other 
agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Appsperse, our
 employees, our users, or others.  This includes exchanging information 
with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit 
risk reduction.</p>

<h3 class="subTitle">G. With Your Consent:</h3><p> Except as set forth 
above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared
 with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this 
information.</p>

<h2 class="sectionTitle">IV. IS PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT ME SECURE?</h2>
<p>Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and 
security.  You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and 
Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password 
appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser
 by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</p>

<p>We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal
 Information we hold in our records, but we cannot guarantee complete 
security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and 
other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any 
time. </p>

<p>The Website may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible 
for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When following
 a link to another site you should read that site's privacy policy.</p>

<h2 class="sectionTitle">V. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION CAN I ACCESS?</h2>
<p>Through your account settings, you may access, and, in some cases, 
edit or delete the following information you've provided to us:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Username and Password</li>
	<li>Name</li>
	<li>Email Address</li>
	<li>Mailing Address</li>
	<li>User profile information, including images and videos you have uploaded to the site</li>
</ul>

Website changes.  If you have any questions about viewing or updating 
information we have on file about you, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@appsperse.com?Subject=Hello%20contact">contact@appsperse.com.</a>

</p><p>Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California 
residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories
 of Personal Information which we share with our affiliates and/or third
 parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for 
such affiliates and/or third parties.  If you are a California resident 
and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request 
to:<a href="mailto:legal@appsperse.com?Subject=Hello%20legal"> legal@appsperse.com.</a></p>

<h2 class="sectionTitle">VI. WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>You can always opt not to disclose information to use, but keep in 
mind some information may be needed to register with us or to take 
advantage of some of our special features.</li>
<li>You may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained 
in Section V above.  When you update information, however, we may 
maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.  You may 
request deletion of your account by contacting Appsperse at <a href="mailto:contact@appsperse.com?Subject=Hello%20contact">contact@appsperse.com.</a>
 or by deactivating and deleting your account within the service. Please
 note that the Information will remain in our private records after your
 deletion of such information from your account. We may use any 
aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information 
after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify 
you personally.</li>

<h2 class="sectionTitle">VII. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time.  Use of 
information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at
 the time such information is used.   If we make changes in the way we 
use Personal Information, we will notify you by posting an announcement 
on our Website or sending you an email. You are bound by any changes to 
the Privacy Policy when you use the Website after such changes have been
 first posted.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message to: <a href="mailto:contact@appsperse.com?Subject=Hello%20contact">contact@appsperse.com.</a>  We will make every effort to resolve your concerns.</p>
